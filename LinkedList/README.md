Linked List Implementation in C++
This is a C++ implementation of a linked list data structure. The linked list allows dynamic insertion and removal of elements and provides operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, finding elements, and more.

Features
Insertion of elements at the front (push_front()) and back (push_back()) of the list
Removal of elements from the front (pop_front()) and back (pop_back()) of the list
Insertion and removal at specific positions in the list (insert(), erase())
Retrieval of the first element (front()) and last element (back()) of the list
Checking if the list is empty (empty())
Finding elements in the list (find())
Traversing the list and printing its elements in the forward or reverse order (traverse(), reverse())
Sorting the list using the merge sort algorithm (sort())
Clearing the list and deallocating memory (clear())
Getting the size of the list (size())

Usage
To use the linked list in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1.Include the list.h header file in your source file(s) where you want to use the linked list.
2.Create an instance of the List class with the desired element type. For example, to create a linked list of integers:  List<int> myList;
3.Use the available member functions to perform operations on the list.
